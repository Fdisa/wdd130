    <h3>Dia de Muertos</h3>
    <div class="grid7">
    <p>Day of the dead is a celebration on November 1 and 2. 
      The belief is people who passed away come on these days to visit their families and closest ones. 
      They also eat and enjoy these days of celebration. This is the reason why people in Mexico visit cemeteries, decorate tombs, put food on altars and pictures of their loved ones who passed away. 
      People usually paint their faces in the shape of skulls to remember their ancestors. 
      This is an unforgettable experience that anyone should lose. </p>
